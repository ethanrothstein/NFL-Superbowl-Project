# NFL-Superbowl-Project
Hello there! 

Welcome to my Superbowl Project that I have created on my freetime. I gathered a bunch of data from a dataset through Kaggle and decided to dive deeper and get a better understanding of the NFL's Super Bowl history. I wrote all of my code using Oracle SQL and then created a website using the App Developer.
